        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The charges regarding services to be provided by GGLink are outlined on the first 
          project brief that the Client receives via email before the project commencement.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The initial project brief includes the following information: project description, functionalities breakdown, use cases, and pages list. A precise list of tasks, which is the product of the previously defined information, will be created. The initial quote is always based on the number of tasks collected and the average predictable time to spend for each one of them. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          All the projects require an advance payment of fifty (50) per cent of the initial project quotation before the project commencement. The remaining balance payment will be due upon completion of the project, prior to any upload, installation or project files delivery. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Charges are strictly tied to the list of single tasks agreed upon and outlined on the first brief, and the expected time to spend in order to complete them. The defined tasks and functionalities list agreed upon may change during the ongoing of the project as new functionalities may be required.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Any change to the initial tasks list will be promptly communicated to the Client with the updated quote. The approval of the Client to any variation on the original tasks list is always required. Hereby the client agrees that the initial quotation may vary when a task on the original tasks list gets added, modified or removed; and any additional price will be charged and paid due to the final payment. The Client also hereby agrees that additional tasks increase the amount of time to spend on the project, moving the expected deadline forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Payment for services is due to online payment, bank transfer or cheque to Guru Graphics Ltd. Cheques should be made payable to Guru Graphics Ltd, Marco Polo House, 3-5 Lansdowne Rd, Croydon CR0 2BX.

        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          All the Web Design and Web Development projects are tailored to the exact requests of the Client and what has been agreed upon with the Client. Our team will always provide the best professional advice and solutions, but the final decision will always be up to the client. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          All the Web Development projects aim to respect the maximum browser compatibility (tests will be performed on: the latest version of Google Chrome / Chromium, the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, the latest version of Safari and the latest version of Opera). Browser compatibility tests on the Microsoft Edge browser and the last stable release of Internet Explorer will be performed, although we don’t guarantee perfect rendering on those two browsers because of browser-related issues. Also, the Company does not guarantee perfect rendering on an outdated browser and it is not able to guarantee complete compatibility with future browser versions. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Any further browser compatibility requirements can be discussed and agreed upon before the project commencement or during the project ongoing. Extra browser-compatibility features are considered additional features to add to the defined tasks list.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          All the Web Development projects are coded to be completely responsive and adaptive, in order to be correctly browsable from the most common mobile devices (smartphones and tablets).
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Any further responsiveness requirements can be discussed and agreed upon before the project commencement or during the project ongoing. Extra responsiveness features are considered additional features to add to the defined tasks list.

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          All the Web Development projects are taught and developed respecting the latest security measures. All the software used and provided by the Company is always updated to the latest version (at the moment of delivery) and fully tested for stability and security issues. Our Company’s approach to security is very strict. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          All the Web Development Projects are made using the latest technologies available on the market, always opting for Open Source solutions (because of financial and security reasons) at their latest stable release. All the software used to perform any job or used to create the web application is always up to date with its latest stable release. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Any aspect of our security approach can be discussed. If a higher level of security is required by the user, the Company will discuss the requirements and proceed accordingly to the Client's directions.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          These technical standards represent the Company’s product quality basic standards, in order to deliver a high-quality product. These standards imply more time spent on the Project, which is meaningful for the agreed tasks list, expected deadline and quote. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Our charges include the previously mentioned features, but for very tight deadlines and/or budgets below £2,000 the Company and the Client hereby agree that only the strictly required optimisation services and best standards will be applied with no extra work, as the final price doesn’t cover the full service.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>

        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>

        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Based on the Project agreement, a web design of the main pages of the Project will be created in order to define the design consistency rules (colour palette, typography, brand consistency, UX).   
        </p>
      </div>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The design created so far is shown to the Client in order to collect feedback. The Client is allowed to perform infinite reviews. A written confirmation will close the current stage once all the required feedback has been implemented, in order to proceed to the next stage.

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          A review of the existing pages is asked to the Client, in order to assess if the web-page version of the design completely matches the previously agreed static web design. The number of reviews should be limited in that case. A written confirmation will close the current stage once all the required feedback has been implemented, in order to proceed to the next stage.

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          A review of the existing web application is asked to the Client, in order to assess if the web application’s functionalities work as expected and agreed upon. The Client is allowed to perform infinite reviews at this stage. A written confirmation will close the current stage once all the required feedback has been implemented, in order to proceed to the next stage.

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
         At this stage, the existing web application gets optimised for a better SEO score and a fast page loading. The responsiveness gets implemented and the cross-browsing gets debugged. A complete web security and version assessment is deeply performed on the web application and all of its components.

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          This is the last, big and final review performed by the Client, as at this stage the web application should have all the features agreed upon at the beginning and during the project ongoing. The Client is here allowed to perform infinite reviews on all the functionalities coming from the defined tasks list. A written confirmation will close the current stage once all the required feedback has been implemented. This final written confirmation acts as a confirmation for the completion of the Project.

          After the final payment of the remaining amount, the Project and all the material produced and available to the Company get delivered to the Client. The Client may decide to entitle the Company to the installation and configuration of the web application. In case, this service comes for free. The Client hereby agrees that in no circumstances the Company is able to deliver the project before the final payment.

        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          A first Project review is planned during the design phase to collect the feedback about the design done so far and finalise it. The Company will keep showing the Client the design completed so far, in order to finalise it and proceed to the next stage. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          A second Project review is planned after the front-end development phase, in order to collect the feedback on the coding of the previously agreed design, which will be available to be browsed via a beta link. This review is required to show how the design has been transformed into coded web pages. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          Please note that at this second review the code produced so far is usually not optimised for responsiveness and cross-browsing features, and contains no functionalities. It is for graphical showing purposes only and the Company won’t take note of any different kinds of feedback at this stage.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          A third Project review is planned after the back-end functionalities implementation. This review is in order to show how the previously coded web pages have been populated with dynamic information and how the system functionalities have been implemented. The Client is asked to test the web application in order to check if it behaves as expected and agreed.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          A final Project review is planned once the project has been completed and optimised. At this stage, the Client is asked to fully test the website as at this stage the Project should be completed. A confirmation of the completion of the project is agreed upon once the final payment runs.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The Client hereby agrees that will not ask or force the Company to show the work performed so far if the Company declares that it’s not ready to be shown at the project's current stage.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The Client hereby agrees to provide the correct feedback at the right time: all the design feedback must be given during the design phase when the Client is asked for a review. The same rule is applied for the front and back-end development.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The Client hereby agrees that once a stage of development is finalised, the ongoing work will proceed as per schedule. If the Client comes up with new feedback belonging to any previous stage, the current stage will stop at the nearest breakpoint until the previous stage has been finalised again.
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The Client hereby agrees that the Company is not liable for any delay on the agreed deadline due to any feedback implementation or extra review. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The Client hereby agrees that will be allowed to provide as many reviews as he/she prefers at any stage, making sure that the feedback will be coherent with the current stage of the Project. 
        </p>

        <p className={"mb-4"}>
          The Client hereby agrees that a written (email, document) confirmation is required to close a review and finalise the current stage, in order to proceed to the next stage.
